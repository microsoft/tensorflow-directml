| [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorflow-directml.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorflow-directml) | [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/microsoft/WindowsAI/_apis/build/status/TensorFlow/TF%20-%20Nightly%20Build?branchName=directml)](https://dev.azure.com/microsoft/WindowsAI/_build/latest?definitionId=56563&branchName=directml) |

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. This repository is a fork of [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) that leverages [DirectML](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML) to provide cross-vendor hardware acceleration on Windows 10 and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). TensorFlow with DirectML enables training and inference of complex machine learning models on a wide range of DirectX 12-compatible hardware.

## Getting Started

TensorFlow with DirectML is supported on both the latest versions of Windows 10 and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about). For detailed instructions on getting started, see [GPU accelerated ML training (docs.microsoft.com)](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs). Official Python packages are available on the [tensorflow-directml PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-directml/).

TensorFlow with DirectML is still in active development and is in a preview state. The DirectML repository includes [a few samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/TensorFlow) that have been tested to work with the latest builds on PyPI. These samples include both inference and training scripts, and you can either train the models from scratch or use the supplied pre-trained weights. However, we encourage testing on any TensorFlow 1.15-compatible models -- if you run into issues, please let us know!

The following resources provide additional background on DirectML and TensorFlow:
- [DirectML GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/)
- [RFC: TensorFlow on DirectML](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/243)
- [TensorFlow homepage](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## System Requirements

### Windows 10

* Windows 10 Version 1709, 64-bit (Build 16299 or higher)
* Python x86-64 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7<sup>1</sup>
* One of the following supported GPUs:
  * AMD Radeon R5/R7/R9 2xx series or newer
  * Intel HD Graphics 5xx or newer
  * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 9xx series GPU or newer

<sup>1</sup> Note: Python 3.8 or newer is **not** currently supported. To use the official PyPi packages, the CPython interpreter is required. NumPy 1.19.4 is [currently experiencing issues on Windows](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/FMod-Bug-on-Windows); this can be resolved by pinning the NumPy version, e.g. `pip install numpy==1.19.3`.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Windows 10 Insider Preview, 64-bit (Build 20150 or higher)
* Python x86-64 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7<sup>2</sup>
* One of the following supported GPUs:
  * AMD Radeon R5/R7/R9 2xx series or newer, and [20.20.01.05 WSL driver](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-wsl-support)
  * Intel HD Graphics 5xx or newer, and [28.20.100.8322 WSL driver](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29526)
  * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 9xx series GPU or newer, and [460.20 WSL driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl/download)

<sup>2</sup> Note: Python 3.8 or newer is **not** currently supported. To use the official PyPi packages, the CPython interpreter is required.

## License

This project is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

The tensorflow-directml Python wheel binary package includes a redistributable version of the DirectML library, which is downloaded automatically as a part of the build. The use of the redistributable DirectML library is governed by a separate license that is found as part of the package (found in `_solib_directml/LICENSE.txt` when extracted).

## Data Collection Notice

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications.

Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

### Disabling Telemetry

The official builds of tensorflow-directml (hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-directml/)) have data collection enabled. This telemetry is enabled when building with `--config=dml_telemetry` (i.e. the `--telemetry` switch in `build.py`), but it is disabled by default for local builds.
