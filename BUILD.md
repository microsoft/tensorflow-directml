# Building TensorFlow-DirectML

This document contains instructions for producing private builds of tensorflow-directml.

## DirectML and DirectML-Dev Branches

This project is a fork of the official [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) repository that targets TensorFlow v1.15. This fork will not merge upstream, since TensorFlow does not accept new features for previous releases, so the `master` branch is based off v1.15.0 from the upstream repository. DirectML changes do not appear in the `master` branch.

The `directml` branch is considered the main branch for development in this repository, and it should be the most stable branch to test. Packages of [tensorflow-directml on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-directml/) are produced from the `directml` branch. This branch contains changes related to DirectML as well as security fixes in the upstream branch (e.g. changes in 1.15.1, 1.15.2, 1.15.3., etc.).

The latest changes occur in the `directml-dev` branch. This branch is intended for rapid development, so builds of the `directml-dev` branch may reference unstable DirectML APIs that are subject to change over time; preview DirectML APIs are included in a special preview redistributable of DirectML that requires *developer mode*. 

## Developer Mode

**The python packages produced from the `directml-dev` branch will not run unless you enable developer mode, since they are not intended to be shipped or distributed for mainstream use**. To enable developer mode:

- **Windows**
  - [Toggle "Developer Mode" to "On"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) in the "For developers" tab of the "Update & Security" section of the Settings app.

- **WSL**
  - Create a plain-text file in your Linux home directory, `~/.directml.conf`, with the contents `devmode = 1`.

## DirectX Development Files

The development headers and libraries used to build DirectX-based applications are included in the Windows SDK; however, this SDK is not available when building for Linux. Additionally, this project may depend on a newer version of DirectML than what is available in Windows SDKs. For these reasons, the DirectX development files are integrated a little differently depending on Windows or Linux builds:

- **Windows**
  -  Direct3D/DXCore Headers: Windows SDK newer than 10.0.19645.0
  -  Direct3D/DXCore Libraries: Windows SDK newer than 10.0.19645.0

- **WSL**
   -  Direct3D/DXCore Headers: `third_party/dml/winadapter`
   -  Direct3D/DXCore Libraries: `/usr/lib/wsl/lib`

For both Windows and WSL, the DirectML headers and libraries are pulled from a redistributable NuGet package. This package is downloaded automatically as a part of the build (see `third_party/dml/redist`). The use of the redistributable DirectML library is governed by a separate license that is found as part of the package (found in `_solib_directml/LICENSE.txt` when extracted).

## Build Environment

Make sure to follow the official build setup instructions ([Windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#:~:text=%20%20%20%20Version%20%20%20,%20Bazel%200.26.1%20%2016%20more%20rows%20), [Linux](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source)) before proceeding. We've tested the following build environments, and we recommend using a Python environment manager like [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to sandbox your builds.

- **Windows**
  - Visual Studio 2017 (15.x)
  - Windows SDK 10.0.19645.0 or later (requires Windows Insider Build)
  - MSYS2 20190524
  - Bazel 0.24.1

- **WSL**
  - Windows 10 Insider Build with WSL feature enabled (you must have libd3d12.so and libdxcore.so in `C:\Windows\System32\lxss\lib`)
  - Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 with g++ package
  - Bazel 0.24.1

**NOTE**: currently, it's only possible to build the Linux version of tensorflow-directml from a WSL environment. The D3D/DXCore libraries are needed for linking and are not yet available through another distribution channel. The DirectML redistributable package requires nuget.exe (a PE executable) to download, which also requires WSL/Windows interop. We hope to remove these restrictions in the near future.

## Build Script

A helper script, build.py, can be used to build this repository with support for DirectML. This script is a thin wrapper around the bazel commands for configuring and build TensorFlow; you may use bazel directly if you prefer, but make sure to include `--config=dml`. Run `build.py --help` for a full list of options, or inspect this file to get a full list of the bazel commands it executes. 

For example, to build the repository and produce a Python wheel use `build.py --package` in a Python 3.5-3.8 environment with `bazel` on the PATH.
